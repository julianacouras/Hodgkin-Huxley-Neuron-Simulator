# Hodgkin-Huxley-Neuron-Simulator
Matlab code for the simulation of a neuron using the Hodgking &amp; Huxley model

This software is currently written in Portuguese, but it is very intuitive. The code that runs the simulator is called HH_Simulator and there one can simulate three main scenarios: voltage clamp, discrete pulses of current and alternate current. You may also generate the behaviour along voltage of the variables h, m,n and the rate and tau variables in the right upper corner. You do need to push Start to begin any simulation of the three stated above when you open the program for the first time, but you don't need to push it again to change the type of simulation, simply push the button of the simulation you want next and it will restart. If you push multiple times the button that says "Pulso" you will be able to observe the refractory period effect in the simulation.
